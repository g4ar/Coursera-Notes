Introduction to troubleshooting and the future of networking
    Error detetection is the ability for a protocol or program to determine something went wrong
    Error recovery is the ability for a protocol to attempt to fix an error
        For Example, cyclical redundancy checks are used to ensure the correct data was received, if not the data is discarded,
        then the transport layer decides weather the data needs to be resent.
    Errors can still occur, hardware can breakdown, misconfigurations can occur and systems may be incompatible.

    Module Goals:
        1. Detect & fix network connectivity tools using tools on the 3 most common systems
        2. Cover future important networking topics such as The cloud & IPv6

Ping: Internet control message protocol
    The most common issue in network connectivity is the inability to establish connection.
    When a network error occurs, the device that detects it needs some way to communicate this to the source this is where ICMP comes in.
    ICMP (Internet control message protocol) is used by routers or remote hosts to explain why a transmission has failed. They do this through packets.
    ICMP Packets are made up of:
        Type Field- 8 bits along which specifies what message is being delivered
        code field- indicates a more specific reason for the message such as destination unreachable ect.
        Checksum- 16 bit checksum that confirms the data is intact 
        Rest of header- 32 bit field optionally used by some of the specific types and codes to send more data.
        Payload for ICMP packet - exists so the recipient of the message knowns which of their transmissions caused the error
            contains the entire IP header and the first 8 bytes of the data payload section of the offending packet.

    ICMP was more developed for communication between computers than for human interaction, but we have tools to troubleshoot.
    One of these tools is called ping. Every OS has one.
    Ping lets you send a type of ICMP message called an Echo request.
    an ICMP Echo request checks to see if a destination is up and running. If it is, the network will respond with a ICMP Echo
    reply
    You can invoke the echo via "ping" on the command line, followed by the domain name.
    CONTROL C invokes a interrupt on Mac & Linux, which continues to repeat ping until interrupted

    Traceroute
    Traceroute is a utility that lets you discover the path between two nodes, and gives you information about each hop along the way

    Traceroute uses the TTL field by slowly increasing the TTL to log each router hop.
    When using traceroute you will see the time it takes for each of the three packets, the IP they arrived at, and a hostname if
    able to be resolved
    Other tools similar to traceroute (basically long running traceroutes)
        MTR - Linux & MacOS (constantly updates)
        pathping- Windows (runs for 50 seconds then displays all data)

    Testing Port connectivity
    Testing to see if things are working at the transport layer is best done through the following tools:
        netcat- Linux & MacOS
            Can be run through command nc requires an argument of both a host and a port
            If you just want to check status you can plug in -z (Which stands for zero input/output mode)
            A -v flag (verbose) is also useful as it makes the command readable to humans
                combining both of these will tell us if we can connect to the host through that port
        test-netconnection - Windows
            if you only use netconnect with a host it will default to ICMP, but will display more data than ping
            -port will test connectivity to a port 

    Supplemental reading for netcat & test-netconnection
        netcat
            nc [options] <host> <port>
        nc -u <host> <port>: flag would attempt a connection through UDP instead of TCP
        nc -z <host> <port>: would scan for open ports 
        nc -vv <host> <port>:is very verbose and gives more output text
        nc -p <localport> <host> <port>: refers to a local port
        nc -e <program> <host> <port>: executes a program after connection is established
        nc -n <addr> <port>: Prevents DNS lookup, use this when avoiding overhead of DNS lookup or if DNS is not working

        Test-Netconnection
            Test-NetConnection <host> <port>
        Test-NetConnection -InformationLevel "Detailed": test ping with detailed results
        Test-NetConnection -ComputerName [remote host]: tests a connection to a remote host
        Test-NetConnection -ComputerName [remote host] -Port [port number]: Tests TCP connectivity to a specific host & port, can be combined
            with the detailed results 
        Test-NetConnection -ComputerName [remote host] -DiagnoseRouting: performs route diagnostics to connect to a remote host, requires admin privileges
        Test-NetConnection -ComputerName [remote host] -constrainInterface [interface number] -DiagnoseRouting -InformationLevel "Detailed": performs route diagnostics
            to connect to remote host with routing constraints.

    Name Resolution tools
        most common command line tool to help with name resolution:
        nslookup available on all three OS's 
        basic use:
            nslookup <hostname>
                output: server that performed request & the resolution results
            example:
            nslookup twitter.com
                Non-authoritative answer:
                Name:   Twitter.com
                Address:    104.244.42.193
                Name:   Twitter.com
                Address:    104.244.42.65
        You can also use it as an interactive tool:
            nslookup
                >
        From here you can enter multiple names in a row while also performing extra configuration
        for example if you type "server <IP Address>" all the attempts will be made using that server instead of the default
        name server
        You can also enter "set type =<resource record type>", by default it will return A records, but you can ask for others
        If you want to see exactly what's going on you can enter "debug" to display the full response packets, including intermediary
        responses

    Public DNS servers
    an ISP almost always gives you access to a recursive name server as part of the service it provides
    another option is to run your own DNS server to be able to name your devices
    the last option is DNS as a service
    Public DNS servers- name servers specifically setup so that anyone can use them for free 
    Level 3 communications is one of the largest ISPs in the world, they're so big they sell network to OTHER ISP's
    the IP addresses for level 3's public DNS severs are 4.2.2.1 - 4.2.2.6 these servers have never been acknowleged by LVL3
    Google's public IP servers are: 8.8.8.8 & 8.8.4.4 these are officially documented & acknowleged by Google 
    Most public DNS servers are available globally through anycast.
    Hijacking outbound DNS requests with faulty responses is an easy way to redirect your users to malicious sites, so always
    make sure the name server is run by a reputable company and try to use name servers provided by your ISP outside of 
    troubleshooting scenarios.
    Most public DNS servers also respond to ICMP echo requests, so they're a good choice for testing general internet connectivity with ping

    DNS Registration & expiration
    DNS is a global system managed with ICANN, meaning domains need to be globally unique.
    Registrar - an orginization responsible for assigning individual domain names to other organizations
    Network Solutions INC used to be responsible for almost all domains that weren't country specific
    Creating a domain name:
        Create an account with a Registrar
        search their web UI for a domain name to determine if it's still available
        pay for it
        agree to the length of its Registration
    once owned, you can either have the registrar act as the authoritative name server for the domain or configure your own servers
    to be authoritative.
    Domain names can also be transfered between parties

    Host files
    the original way that addresses were correlated with words was through host files
    host files are evaluated by the networking stack of the operating system itself
    All modern OS's still have host files, because of loopback address. 
    A loopback address is a way of sending network information to yourself.
    the loopback IP for IPv4 127.0.0.1 and is configured through a hostfile
    almost every hostfile in existence will, at the very last, contain a line that reads 127.0.0.1 localhost, most likely followed by
    ::1 where ::1 is the loopback address for IPv6
    DNS kinda killed host files
    Host files are a popular way for computer viruses to disrupt & redirect computer traffic

    What is the cloud?
    The cloud is a concept for cloud computing
    cloud computing- a new model in computing where large clusters of machines let us use the total resources available in a more efficient way
    cloud computing is a technological approach where computing resources are provisioned in a shareable way so that a lot of
    users get what they need, when they need it
    Hardware virtualization is a core concept on how cloud computing works. It allows a physical machine and a logical machine to
    be abstracted away from each other. 
    Virtualization- A single physical machine (or host) could run many individual virtual instances, called guests
    Hardware virtualization platforms employ hypervisors
    hypervisors are pieces of software that run and manage VM's while also offering guests a virtual operating platform thats
    indistinguishable from the actual hardware
    Public cloud - a large cluster of machines run by another company
    Private cloud - used by a single large corporation and generally physically hosted on its own premises
    Hybrid cloud- a term used to describe where companies might run things like their most sensitive proprietary tech on a private cloud, while entrusting
    their less sensitive servers to a public cloud

    Everything as a server
