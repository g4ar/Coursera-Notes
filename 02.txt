Introduction to network
Datalink: Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast:
    Unicast is One device to another device is a transmission meant for one specific address 
    
    Multicast is sent to multiple devices, accepted or discarded depending on criteria

    Broadcast is sent to all devices, accomplished using boradcast address, all F's, used so devices can learn about one another

Dissecting an Ethernet Frame:
   "Data packet" all encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent across a network link
   "Ethernet frame" - a highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order
        First part of ethernet frame is preamble, an 8 bytes (64 bit) section that can be split into two sections first 7 are alternating 1's & 0's
        Start frame delimiter which signals to a recieving device that the preamble is over and the frame will now follow
        Destination MAC address- hardware address of the recipiant
        Source address is where the frame originated from
        Ether type field 16 bits long and used to describe the protocol of the contents of the frame
        vlan header indicates that it's a vlan, which is a virtual LAN
        Payload is the actual data being transported
        Frame Check Sequence a 4 byte number that represents a checksum value (cyclical redundancy check important for data integrity)


Intro to Network Layer:
    LAN: Nodes communciate through MAC address (bad for scaling)

    IP address
        32 bit numbers in 4 octets represented in binary for a total of 8 bytes
        distributed in large sections by heirarchy
        IP Addresses 32 bit octate
        IP distrubted in large numbers, for example IBM every IP owned contains 9 in the
        first octete
        most modern networks with use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) which
        assigns a Dynamic IP address
        Static IP addresses never change, and are mostly assigned to servers
  
  IP Datagrams and Encapsulation
    Packets on the network layer are called IP datagram, which is a high structured
    series of fields that are strictly defined.
    first 4 bits are the verion number, being either IPv4 or IPv6 ( IP most comon is IPv4, IPv6 is beggining to see more adoption)
    Second 4 bits is the header length field, which is almost always 20 bytes when dealing with IPv4 (20 is the minimum)
    Service type is the next 8 bits, which qualify QoS technologies
    Next are total length which indicates the total length of the data field
    Identification field is a 16-bit number that's used to group messages together
    The maximum size of a single datagram is the largest number you can represnt with 16bits (65,535)
    If the total amount of data is larger, it splits it into many idividual packs, the identifier is then used to group them
    Flag field is used to indicate if a datagram is allowed to be, or is already fragmented
    framentation is the process of taking a single IP datagram and splitting it into several smaller datagrams
    TTL 8 bit field that indicates how many routers a packet can traverse
    Protocol field is 8 bit field about what transport layer protcols are being used (most common being TCP & UDP)
    Header checksum checks the entire datagram for integrity
    IP address is 32 bit
    IP options is an optional field used to set special characteristics mostly used primarily for testing purposes
    Padding field a series of zeros used to ensure the header is the correct total size
    The entire contents of datagrams are encapsulated as the payload of an ethernet frame
    
IP address classes
  IP addressses are either the network ID or host ID
  Network ID is first part of IP address, the rest is host ID
  Address class system is a way of defining global IP system into class a, b, and c
    Address class system:
    class A includes those used where the first octete is used for the Network ID and the rest is host ID
    class B are where first two octetes are used for Network ID and the second two are used for host ID
    class C are where teh first three octetes are for Network ID and the last is used for host ID
    A starts with 0xxx meaning everything from 1.0.0.0 - 127.0.0.0
    B starts with 10xx meaning everything from 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.0.0
    C starts with 110x meaning everything from 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.0
    D starts with 1110 meaning everything from 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255
    E starts with 1111 meaning everytihing from 240.0.0.0- 255.255.255.255
    Class D is used for multicast
    Class E is only used for testing
    system is now mostly replaced by Classless inter-domain routing
   
Address Resolution Protocol
  ARP is protocol used to discover hardware address of a node with a IP address
  ARP Table is list of IP addresses and MAC addresses associated with them
  When ARP message is recieved, a system will send back an ARP response with it's associated MAC address
  ARP table entries normally change over time
  
Subnetting
  Subnetting is taking a large network and splitting into a bunch of smaller networks
  Incorrect subnetting setups are a common problem
  Gateway router is the entry & exit point into a network
  Core routers mostly only speak to other routers
  
 Subnet Masks
  Subnet ID takes over some of the host ID
  Core routers only care about the Network ID
  The host ID is only used by the last router to deliver to the correct machine on that host
  subnet masks are 32 bit numbers that are normally written out as four octetes in decimal
  Ex.
  IP address 9.100.100.100
  in binary: 0000 1001. 0110 0100. 0110 0100. 0110 0100
  Subnet 255.255.255.0
  Subnet in binary: 1111 1111.1111 1111.1111 1111.0000 0000

  Matching 1's in the binary of a subnet mask are the subnet ID
  while the remaining octetes that have a corresponding 0 are the host ID
  
  Basic Binary Math
    Base ten is 0-9 in a system of whole numbers
    Base two represents 0 or 1
    8 bits would be 2 to the 8th power, 4 bit is 2 to the 4th power ect
    in binary 1+1=10
    addition is an operator
    two of the most important operators are OR and AND
    subnet mask uses and operators to determine if ip exists on the same network
    
    CIDR
        Classless inter domain routing
        uses subnet masks to demarcate networks
        demarcation point - To describe where one network end and another begins 
        CIDR combines subnet and network ID
        CIDR Allows adresss classes to be defined by two individual ID's
        Host ID remains the same in CIDR
        CIDR allows for more flexible network sizes

    Basic routing
    Router- A network device that forwards fraffic depending on the Destination address of that traffic (has at least two points)
    Router recieves packet, examines the Destination IP, looks it up in the routing table, and sends it to the closest router to that point

    Routing tables
    basic routing tables have the following four columns:
    Destination Network the node that each network the table knows about
    Next hop IP adress of the next router, or connect directly to the requester
    Total hops counts the number of hops needed to destination router
    Interface Which of it's interfaces it should send the packet out of

    Interior gateway protocols
    Routing protcols are either interior gateway protocols or exterior gateway protocol
    interior gateway protocols are then split into link state routing protocols and distance vector protocols
    interior gateways are used by routers to share information within a single autonomous system
    
    Exterior gateway Protocols
    Exterior gateway protcols are used to communicate data between routers that represent the edges of an autonomous system
    (Basically they're the protcols used to share information between organizations)
    IANA a non-profit organization that helps manage things like IP address allocation
    ASN autonomous system number allocation
    numbers assigned to individual autonomous systems
    
    Most common distance vector protocols are RIP or routing infomration protocol and EIGRP or enhanced interior gateway routing protcol
    THe most common link-state proctol is OSPF or Open Shortest Path First 
    Only one exterior gateway protcol is in use today, that being BGP or Border Gateway Protcol
    
    Non-Routeable Address Space
    Address that belong to nobody, but can be used by everyone for an internal network
    NRAS IP's: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16
