Introduction to troubleshooting and the future of networking
    Error detetection is the ability for a protocol or program to determine something went wrong
    Error recovery is the ability for a protocol to attempt to fix an error
        For Example, cyclical redundancy checks are used to ensure the correct data was received, if not the data is discarded,
        then the transport layer decides weather the data needs to be resent.
    Errors can still occur, hardware can breakdown, misconfigurations can occur and systems may be incompatible.

    Module Goals:
        1. Detect & fix network connectivity tools using tools on the 3 most common systems
        2. Cover future important networking topics such as The cloud & IPv6

Ping: Internet control message protocol
    The most common issue in network connectivity is the inability to establish connection.
    When a network error occurs, the device that detects it needs some way to communicate this to the source this is where ICMP comes in.
    ICMP (Internet control message protocol) is used by routers or remote hosts to explain why a transmission has failed. They do this through packets.
    ICMP Packets are made up of:
        Type Field- 8 bits along which specifies what message is being delivered
        code field- indicates a more specific reason for the message such as destination unreachable ect.
        Checksum- 16 bit checksum that confirms the data is intact 
        Rest of header- 32 bit field optionally used by some of the specific types and codes to send more data.
        Payload for ICMP packet - exists so the recipient of the message knowns which of their transmissions caused the error
            contains the entire IP header and the first 8 bytes of the data payload section of the offending packet.

    ICMP was more developed for communication between computers than for human interaction, but we have tools to troubleshoot.
    One of these tools is called ping. Every OS has one.
    Ping lets you send a type of ICMP message called an Echo request.
    an ICMP Echo request checks to see if a destination is up and running. If it is, the network will respond with a ICMP Echo
    reply
    You can invoke the echo via "ping" on the command line, followed by the domain name.
    CONTROL C invokes a interrupt on Mac & Linux, which continues to repeat ping until interrupted

    Traceroute
    Traceroute is a utility that lets you discover the path between two nodes, and gives you information about each hop along the way

    Traceroute uses the TTL field by slowly increasing the TTL to log each router hop.
    When using traceroute you will see the time it takes for each of the three packets, the IP they arrived at, and a hostname if
    able to be resolved
    Other tools similar to traceroute (basically long running traceroutes)
        MTR - Linux & MacOS (constantly updates)
        pathping- Windows (runs for 50 seconds then displays all data)

    Testing Port connectivity
    Testing to see if things are working at the transport layer is best done through the following tools:
        netcat- Linux & MacOS
            Can be run through command nc requires an argument of both a host and a port
            If you just want to check status you can plug in -z (Which stands for zero input/output mode)
            A -v flag (verbose) is also useful as it makes the command readable to humans
                combining both of these will tell us if we can connect to the host through that port
        test-netconnection - Windows
            if you only use netconnect with a host it will default to ICMP, but will display more data than ping
            -port will test connectivity to a port 

    Supplemental reading for netcat & test-netconnection
        netcat
            nc [options] <host> <port>
        nc -u <host> <port>: flag would attempt a connection through UDP instead of TCP
        nc -z <host> <port>: would scan for open ports 
        nc -vv <host> <port>:is very verbose and gives more output text
        nc -p <localport> <host> <port>: refers to a local port
        nc -e <program> <host> <port>: executes a program after connection is established
        nc -n <addr> <port>: Prevents DNS lookup, use this when avoiding overhead of DNS lookup or if DNS is not working

        Test-Netconnection
            Test-NetConnection <host> <port>
        Test-NetConnection -InformationLevel "Detailed": test ping with detailed results
        Test-NetConnection -ComputerName [remote host]: tests a connection to a remote host
        Test-NetConnection -ComputerName [remote host] -Port [port number]: Tests TCP connectivity to a specific host & port, can be combined
            with the detailed results 
        Test-NetConnection -ComputerName [remote host] -DiagnoseRouting: performs route diagnostics to connect to a remote host, requires admin privileges
        Test-NetConnection -ComputerName [remote host] -constrainInterface [interface number] -DiagnoseRouting -InformationLevel "Detailed": performs route diagnostics
            to connect to remote host with routing constraints.
