The file contains the notes for Week 5 of Course 2 for the Google IT support Professional

    Introduction to connecting to the internet:
    Desktop, laptops, servers, routers & switches, tablets cell phones atms, industrial equipment, cars and the internet of things.
    End of module goals:
        1. Describe various internet connectivity technologies
        2. Define components of WAN's and outline basics of wireless and cellular networking

    Dial Up, Modems & Point to point protocols:
    Early network tech focused on trying to connect close together computers
    Public switched telephone network (PSTN) or plain old telephone system (POTS) was already a pretty global system,
    so Duke grads used them to create dial up, using a form called USENET
    A dial up connection uses POTS for data transfer, and gets it's name because the connection is established by actually dialing a phone number
    Modem = Modulator/Demodulator
    Baud rate how many bits can be passed across a phone lines in seconds
    110BPS was pretty common back then, but increased to 14.4kbps when Dial-up became a home standard

    What is broadband?
    The term broadband in terms of internet connectivity means any connectivity that isn't dial-up internet
    They're long lasting connections that don't need to be established on each use.
    T-carrier technologies were orginally invented by AT&T in order to transmit multiple phone calls over a single link
    This was very useful for buisnesses that often had multiple people using the same lines at once
    A single photo taken on a smartphone today would've taken 20 minutes just to load on dial-up.
    four most common broadband solutions:
        1. T-Carrier technologies
        2. Digital subscriber lines or DSL 
        3. Cable broadband
        4. fiber connections
    
    T-carrier technologies
    First invented by at&t where multiple calls could happen on the same lines
    Every phone call was made over individual pairs of copper wire before Transmission system 1, the first T-carrier spec (Called T1)
    T1 could carry up to 24 simultanious calls on one twisted pair 
    Each of the 24 channels could carry up to 64kb/s which made the whole thing capable of transmitting 1.544mb/s
    Over the years this has changed to where T1 is just any twisted pair over connection speeds of 1.544 mb/s
    Originally T1 was only used to connect different company sites & other telecom company sites
    when the internet exploded in the 90's buisnesses starting buying T1 installations
    T3 is 28 T1's all multiplexed together to achieve 44.736mb/s 
    These are basically all replaced by Fiber or broadband options

    Digital Subscriber lines
    DSL operates at a different frequency than normal phone calls on the same wire.
    By using this different frequency, DSL was able to send much more data than traditional dial up.
    Because of the different frequencies this also meant that both were able to operate without interfering with one another.
    Unlike dial-up they were able to run for longer distances.
    The two most common types of DSL were:
        ADSL
        (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) features different speeds for incoming & outgoing data, generally this meant faster
        download speeds and slower upload. This worked well for the average home, as they were mostly consumers.
        SDLS
        (Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line) is basically the same as ADSL except upload & download speeds are the same. SDSL was mainly
        used by buisnesses who needed to send data to clients, but is now used by both home and businesses.
        Most SDLS's have a upper cap of 1.544 mb/s, same as a T1 line.
        Further development has brought about HDSL (High Bit-rate Digital subscriber lines) these are DSL's that provision speeds above
        1.544 mb/s.

    Cable broadband
        In the 1940's the first TV's were made to operate on cables instead of towers.
        1984 Cable Communications policy act deregulated the cable television buisness, alloiwng for massive growth. 
        by 1990 cabnle television infrastructure in the US was about the size of POTS

        Cable companies quickly realized that coaxial cables used by televisions were capable of transmitting much more data than a TV needed.
        By using a different frequency on the same cable, companies were able to transmit data of internet based applications at a very high speed.
        at the edge of consumer's network connecting their network to the ISP's core network is a Cabler modem, which connects to the CMTS (Cable Modem Termination System)

    Fiber Connections
    The core of the internet is built off fiber for faster connectivity and lower drop rate over longer areas by using light.
    The maximium distance an electric signal can travel across a copper wire before it degrades too much is thousands of feet.
    Fiber can travel many miles before degrading.
    Producing & laying fiber is very expensive, so it used to be only used by data centers & ISP
    FTTX (Fiber to the X) Fiber laying closer to clients became more previlant so this term was used
        (FTTN) Fiber to the Neighborhood, fiber is laid out to a cabinet serving a large community

            {FTTB Fiber to the building, this is a setup where fiber technologies are used for data delivery to an individual building
            FTTH Fiber to the home, this is used in instances where fiber is run to each home or apartment complex.} May also be reffered to as FTTP
            or fiber to the premises. Instead of a mdoem, the demarcation point for fiber technologies is known as the Optical Network Terminator or ONT.
            ONT converts data from protocols the fiber network can understand
