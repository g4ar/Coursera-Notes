This text begins at the start of Anatomy of a Domain Name in week 4
    Any given domain name has three parts:
    Subdomain (or host name): www
    Domain: name block
    TLD: ex: .com
    Fully qualified domain name is all of these put together
    ICANN handles TLD names
    (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)
    Domains are used to demarcate where control moves from a TLD name server to an authoritative name server
    A registrar is a company that has an agreement with ICANN to sell unregistered domain names
    DNS can technically support up to 127 levels of domain in total for a single fully qualified name
    Each individual section can onlly be 63 characters long and a complete FQDN is limited to a total of 255 characters

    DNS Zones:
    Each TLD name server is responsible for it's root zone, and each root is responsible for each underneath
    They're actually authoritative servers, but just much smaller responsibliity
    the reason for DNS zones is to allow for easier control over multiple levels
    SPlitting configurations allows for easier organization
    Zone files are simple configuration files that declare all resource records for a particular zone
    a zone file has to contain an SOA or start of Authority resource record delcartion
    This SOA record declares the zone and name of the server that is it's Authority
    Normally these files also contain NS records, which indicate other name servers that are also repsonible for this zone
    Having multiple servers in place means it decentralizes, so if one fails you have others that are able to find the information
    Reverse lookup zone files - let DNS ressolvers ask for an IP and get the FQDN associate with it returned

    DHCP
    Every computer on a modern TCP/IP based network needs to have at least four things specifically configured:
        1. An IP Adresss
        2. The subnet mask
        3. A primary gateway
        4. A name server
    Three are mostly the same on every node: The subnet mask, the primary gateway and the DNS server
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is an application layer protocol that automates the configuartion
    process of hosts on a network. A machine can query a DHCP server and recieve all it's configuration for the network in one go

    DHCP reduces administartion, and makes IP choice for the admin
    Using DHCP you can consistently make sure every 

    Dynamic allocation  a range of IP addresses is set aside for client devices and one of these IP's is issued to these devices when requested
    Automatic allocation a range of IP addresses is set aside for assignment purposes only
    DHCP is in charge or remembering all IP's assigned to a MAC address
    Fixed allocation requires a manually specified list of MAC adresses and their assigned IP
    In fixed allocation DHCP must search is ARP table to find the IP/MAC address, if unable to find it may assign a new one, or not assign at all
    DHCP could also be used to establish NTP (network time protocol servers) used to keep all computers on a network synchronized in time

    DHCP in action 
    DHCP is a application layer protocol that relies on the other layers to be functioning in order to work
    DHCP discovery is the process in which a client configured to use DHCP attempt to get network configuration information
    It's split into the following steps:
        1. Server discovery
            The DHCP client sends a DHCP discovery message. Since the machine doesn't have an IP, it specially crafts the broadcast message
            DHCP listens on UDP port 67 & these kinds of messages are always sent from UDP port 68
            the discover message is encapsulated in a UDP datagram with the destination port of 67, source of 68.
            this datagram is then encapsulated in an IP datagram with a destination IP of 255.255.255.255 and a source of 0.0.0.0
            This broadcast message would get delivered to every node. If a DHCP server is present it would recieve the message
        2. IP Offer
            Next the DHCP server examines it's own configuration and makes a decision on what IP address to offer, if any.
            This depends on address allocation configuration.
            This response is sent back as a DHCPOFFER sending back using information offered up by the datagram orginally 
        3. DCHP Request
            DHCP Request is the acceptance signal of a IP offered to it
        4. DHCP ACK
            Lastly the DHCP server recieves the message and DHCPACK's back, sending the IP it's allowed the client to have

            All of this is known as the DHCP lease, and it includes an expiration. Anywhere from a few days to only a short amount of time
            When the lease expires, this process would have to renegotiate a lease all over again

    Basics of NAT
    Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technique instead of a protocol
    Takes one IP address and translates it into another, weather for conserving space or security reasons.
    NAT allows a gateway, usually a router or firewall , to rewrite the source IP of an outgoing IP datagram while retaining the original IP
    in order to rewrite it into the response

    In addition to calculating a checksum, decreasing packet TTL by 1, inspecting content of the IP datagram, the NAT router will rewrite the source IP
    the source IP will instead become the router that is sending the packet, instead of the computer that originally sent it
    This process of hiding the IP is called IP masquerading. It's an important security concept used to keep entire networks IP's secured.
    When multiple networks are all running under a single NAT, it's called a one to many NAT

    NAT and the transport layer
    Port preservation is a technique where the source port chosen by a client is the same port used by the router
    roughly this preserves a port number as the port that a certain IP is using. So when the data returns to that port, the network knows which system
    the information is meant for.
    Port forwarding is a technique where a specific destiation port be configured to alwasy be delivered to a specific node
    This technique allows for complete IP masquerading while still having services that can respond to incoming traffic

    NAT, non-routeable address space and the limits of IPv4
    IANA has been in charge of IP since 1988, mostly assigning IP's to the various RIR's
    Regional internet registries (RIR):
        AFRINIC serves Africa
        ARIN Serves the US, Canada, and parts of the caribbean
        APNIC most of Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific islands
        LACNIC covers Central and South America, and any parts of the Caribbean not covered by ARIN
        RIP serves Europe, Russian, and the Middle East and portions of central Asia
    The last /8 network block was allocated Febuary 3, 2011.
    April 2011, APNIC runs out of address
    RIPE runs out September 2012
    LACNIC runs out June 2014
    ARIN ran out September 2015
    Only AFNIC has IP's left, but are expected to run out by 2018 
       AFRINIC entered IPv4 Exhaustion Phase 2 January 2020

    Reading for IPv4 Address Exhaustion
        IPv4 has nearly Exhausted at time of writing
        Regional Internet Registries assign IP addresses to devices in their physical Area 
        IPv6 provides infinietly more IP addresses and willl solve the IPv4 address exhaustion issues over time.
        
    Virtual Private Networks:
    VPN a technology that allows for the extension of a private or local network to a host that might not work on that same network
    VPN is a tunneling protocol, which means it goes somewhere not locally available
    VPN works by creating a virtual interface with an IP that matches the address space of the network they've tunneled to
    By sending data through the virtual interface they can encrypt the payload that carries the other layers to travel through those layers on the local network
    Then the payload is broken down into it's proper layers, and decrypted to the layers needed
    Two factor authentication is a technique often used by VPN's where more than just the username and password of a user is
    required to join the network (usually done through a authentication code on a piece of software or hardware)
    Important takeaway:
        A VPN is a technology that uses encrypted tunnels to allow for a remote connection to act as if connected to a network that 
        the user is not actually physically connected to

    Proxy Services
        A proxy service is a server that acts on behalf of a client in order to access another service
        Proxies provide:
            Anonymity
            security
            Content filtering
            Increased performance
        Example would be a gateway routers, they're not a specific implementation but instead an abstracted idea.
        Proxies normally refer to web proxies, which is used primarily for web traffic.
        Reverse proxy is a service that might appear to be a single server to external clients, but actually represents many servers living behind it
             Ex. Twitter recieves so much traffic that it uses many web servers
             Ex. Decryption goes through decryption hardware then into a reverse proxy to the application servers
        Big takeaway:
            Proxies are any server that act as a intermediary between client and another server


    Random Information:
    Quad A points to an IPv6 address
    Recursive name servers are the DNS server that preform a full name resolution
