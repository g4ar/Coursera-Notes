This file begins from week 3 of Course 2
  
  Intro to the Transport & Application Layer
  Transport layer allows traffic to be directed to specific network applications
  APplication layer allows these applications to communicate in a way they understand
  Goals for the module:
    1. Describe TCP ports & sockets and identify the different componets of a TCP header
    2. Show the difference between connection oriented and connection list protocols
    3. #xplain how TCP is used to ensure data integrity
    
 The Transport Layer:
 The transport layer is responsible for multi-plexing and deplexing, ensuring data integrity through error checking
 and data verification
  End of lesson goals:
    1. Identify the differences between TCP & UDP
    2. Explain the three way handshake
    3. Understand how TCP flags are used in this process
    4. Describe what multi-plexing and demultiplexing are and how they work
      Multiplexing means nodes on a network have the ability to direct traffic toward many different recieving services.
      Demultiplexing is the same concept, just at the recieving end. It's taking traffic that's all aimed at the same node
      and delivering it to the proper recieving service.
    5. Basics of firewalls
  
  Port is a 16 bit number that's used to direct traffic to specific services running on a networked computer
  A server is a progam runing on a computer waiting to be asked for data
  A client is another program that's requesting this data
  difference services run while lisetneing on specific ports for incoming requests
  For example HTTP is normally run on port 80
  Ports are normally denoted with a ":" after an IP address, when written this way it's known as a socket address
  or socket number
  
  FTP file transfer protcol server
  older service used to transfer files from one computer to another, listening on port 21
