Introduction to network
Datalink: Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast:
    Unicast is One device to another device is a transmission meant for one specific address 
    
    Multicast is sent to multiple devices, accepted or discarded depending on criteria

    Broadcast is sent to all devices, accomplished using boradcast address, all F's, used so devices can learn about one another

Dissecting an Ethernet Frame:
   "Data packet" all encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent across a network link
   "Ethernet frame" - a highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order
        First part of ethernet frame is preamble, an 8 bytes (64 bit) section that can be split into two sections first 7 are alternating 1's & 0's
        Start frame delimiter which signals to a recieving device that the preamble is over and the frame will now follow
        Destination MAC address- hardware address of the recipiant
        Source address is where the frame originated from
        Ether type field 16 bits long and used to describe the protocol of the contents of the frame
        vlan header indicates that it's a vlan, which is a virtual LAN
        Payload is the actual data being transported
        Frame Check Sequence a 4 byte number that represents a checksum value (cyclical redundancy check important for data integrity)


Intro to Network Layer:
    LAN: Nodes communciate through MAC address (bad for scaling)

        IP address
        32 bit numbers in 4 octets represented in binary for a total of 8 bytes
        distributed in large sections by heirarchy
